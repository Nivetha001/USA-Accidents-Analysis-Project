## US-Accidents-Analysis-Project

#### Technology : Business Intelligence
#### Domain     : Transportation
### Inspiration
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accidents hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.

#### * Pandas for Cleaning the Data
#### * Matplotlib, Seaborn for Visualization
#### * Jupyter Notebook for create and share documents that integrate live code, equations, computational output, visualizations, and other multimedia resources, along with explanatory text in a single document.

### Conclusion
* No data from New York
* The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially
* Less than 2% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents.
* 97% of cities have less than 1000 yearly accidents.
* Over 1167 cities have reported just one accident (need to investigate)
